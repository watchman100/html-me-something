                        Unless you've been living under a rock you've probably heard the name before. 
                        At 6'6", this shooting guard changed the league. Michael Jeffery Jordan or 'MJ' 
                        completely took over the NBA in the 90's with the Chicago Bulls. 
                        With the ability to score anywhere on the court and his relentlessness on the defensive end on the court,
                        it's hard to deny him of greatness. A brief listing of his top accomplishments would include the following:
                        Rookie of the Year; Five-time NBA MVP; Six-time NBA champion; Six-time NBA Finals MVP;
                        Ten-time All-NBA First Team; Nine time NBA All-Defensive First Team; Defensive Player of the Year;
                        14-time NBA All-Star; Three-time NBA All-Star MVP; 50th Anniversary All-Time Team; Ten scoring titles
                        -- an NBA record and seven consecutive matching Wilt Chamberlain; Retired with 
                        the NBA's highest scoring average of 30.1ppg; Hall of Fame inductee.

                <p>
                    Lead his team back from a 3-1 lead for the first time in NBA finals history against a 73 win team.
                     Since Lebron has come in the league, he has been a like a train on the court. For almost a decade it felt like
                     every year was what ever team he was on, and whatever team came out of the west; and even today it looks like he's
                     still going. From flying tomahawk dunks to chase down blocks, Leborn could definitely go down as the greatest.

                    If your debating about the greats when it comes to basketball, your're a fool if you dont mention Scranton's finest.
                    when it comes to offense he'll miss 100% of the shots he doesnt take and on the defensive end of the court he'll 
                    occasionally hit somebody with his car, sue him. As far as his persistence on court, he'll go on night long (that's what she said)
                    and he'll never let you down... unless he promises to pay your tuition.

                    How can anyone deny this man of greatness. He has won countless games of king of the court, tip, an old fashioned pickup; 
                    collecting ankles along the way. Aaron plays defense on an elite level and shoots the three better than the rest of them. 
                    When you think of whos the greatest, how can you not think about the time when he hit 5 three in his winter basketball league?
                    How can anyone forget when he scored 38 points in that one pickup game... at that one park... that one time. You can obviously see
                    that this man has earned his way to the top. Battling through knee injuries, his persistence shows that his impact off the court will
                    never be forgotten.
